    "If you are reading this then you are either a sword of Cyr, recollecting our code, or a thief, in which case: return it to any Zephyr of Cyr, and you might recieve our mercy.

All text written assumes the reader is of any of the three Azkuvalian Castes. Given our founding, it shouldn't be a surprise that most of among us are Xyatylians.

In any case: this book details our extensive code of conduct, to ensure understanding amongst your brothers and sisters.",

Cerimonial Fasting^white;

As common in our culture, fasting is a common practice.
We understand some might need to handle such matters with leniency, so for those whom don't: do your best to avoid scolding those whom don't abide to such.",
	"^#CFC041;Code: 2
Cerimonial Rituals and Prayer^white;

As with fasting, this is a common practice but is optional for those whom don't share our beliefs.
Any whom aren't of a Azkuvalian faith, or whom don't share our spiritual beliefs are fine to partake in them, provided they don't interrupt any prayer or ritual.",
	"^#CFC041;Code: 3
Cerimonial Training^white;

As with the previously mentioned, this is a common practice that is encourage.
Whilst one may find martial prowess distasteful, one may find it benificial to their long-term emotional, and physical health.",
	"^#CFC041;Code: 4
Enslavement^white;

In spite of our culture's purpetuation of it, any Zephyr of Cyr caught actively partaking in it will face execution and the slaves exonerated!
If however hedonists are seen using apparel or implements commonly associated with such: they are NOT to be shamed!",
	"^#CFC041;Code: 5
Murder and Oathbreaking^white;

Similar in practice to our culture's common law.
One shall not murder another without cause, and one shall maintain the code of conduct as it's written!",
	"That concludes our written code of conduct.

Speak to a speaker of Cyr, for a full list of what's not allowed."
