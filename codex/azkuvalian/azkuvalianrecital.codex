    "^#00C420;Akatylian verse:^white;
Children of lesser soul.
Witness forth the flame of light!
Let forth the light of fate.
See as it burns the light!
Upon the fire of sin.
Upon the flame of heresy!
Witness forth.
Eternal light!",
    "^#77BFCF;Techpriest verse:^white;
May the flame bear witness.
Upon the flames return!
Sanctity falls as light sees flame.
May the gods bear witness!
To the flame of heresy's fall.
That Arkane sees his fate!
As it will be forever known.
Arekena of the metalic flame!",
    "^#CFC041;Thatylian verse:^white;
The metal shines.
With fiery light!
As sin burns upon the flame.
Beckon forth!
The light of fire.
As it sings with eternal life!
May the gods bear witness.
For their fate is forever known!",
    "^#D74200;Xyatylian verse:^white;
Heresy's flame upon damnation's curse.
Sanctity falls upon the flame's return!
Mortality's disgrace, axitari swine.
Gods forsaken, do they not understand?
A single damned thing of their forsaken fate?
May the gods see to it!
For it shall be ensured.
The light of fire, beckons a new flame!"
