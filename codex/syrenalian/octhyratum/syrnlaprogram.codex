    "Dr. V Velegor, the experiment was a success.

Our first subject was exposed to a large dose of quantum radiation, and Octusaria's chalice crystals.

As much as it was indeed a success, they or it, then tore through most of the facility's illiatari, before eventually being put down by a daminat's psionic ionizer.",
	"Our second subject was also a success, however whilst casualties remained almost the same: we've managed to recapture it.

Needless to say, it is now confined within the high security portion of the facility's labs.",
	"Our third subject we managed to prevent the slaughter of our illiatari, by performing the experiment within the afformentioned labs.

This seems to be the most optimal means of handling the ascension. The Einfierans seem to be rather fond of their newfound selves. They will serve as a useful weapon for Octhyratum.",
	"I'd like to thank the high queen for her generosity to our efforts.

And to an extension, the Talfieran. The volunteers they sent to undermine our efforts, have proved to be worthy test subjects."
