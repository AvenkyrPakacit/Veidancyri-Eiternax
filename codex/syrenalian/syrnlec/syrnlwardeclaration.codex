    "This PSA is written at the behest of the Syrenalian Elder Council.

The Veidancyri have made clear their intent to spark treason amongst out kindred.",
	"Even now, the traitorous queen, Xethyral Vevinastra, plots and sends rebels and spies throughout our sacred moon.

If any of them are seen: report them immediately to the local illiatari or there will be consequences!

Keep close watch of your fellow citizens in your local cities, and towns. If you are found harboring the terrorists, the punishment will be grave!",
	"Our kindred amongst Octhyratum will be assisting The Unitarium in their efforts. Do not interfere with their business!

All of Syrenalia is under threat, The Veidancyri will pay dearly for their opposition!

Remember this, that Dark Syrenalia will remain the eternal home of our kindred. None shall betray Octusaria's children without punishment!"
