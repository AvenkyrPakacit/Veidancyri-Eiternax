    "Alvaneia Talfiera

Calm cinders of fire's light. Cinders of flame born to light. Words spark from written flame.",
	"Varinesa Talfiera

Divine flame is sparked upon the world. Yet she cares not for her birthright, but for those around.",
	"Fiera Talfiera, The Singer of Flames

The alluring light burns with passionate flame.
A song echoes the flame that burns within the heart.
A fiery heart that beckons the love of those around.
For even a mere spark can set a world alight.",
	"Kata 'Hellshot' Shavikskala, The Hell Omen

A flame kindled from the depths of Hell.
An angel of fire bursts forth upon the world.
An eye blazing with hellish flame.
For the Hand of Kata, fires his hellish shot."
