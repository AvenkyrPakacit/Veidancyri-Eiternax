    "Written by Aleraskato of The Syrenalian Ministry of Knowledge in an interview with Avenkyr Pakacit.
In spite of the subject matter, The Unitarium has given the ministry permission to publish this documentation.",
	"As many might know a number of elder councillors acompanied by Octhyratum and The Unitarium travelled to a planet on Earth. When I asked about their potential intent: this was the response.

Humanity has a particular obsession with authority. Leadership and the state is blindly worshiped, doesn't matter what one claims to be: the hierarchial obssession is present. The 'alliance' was a failed reinforcement of power. The Elder Council's pandering to capitalist and communist countries was explicit.",
	"When I then asked about how humanity generally handles it's governments, they hissed although said this.

Same as how any other society that values state authority does. Complicit. The valuing of law enforcement, in spite of individuals whom are targeted for simply existing. The worshiping of nationalism, and the martyring of those whom fight and fall in pointless wars.
Individual life is cared little for, only state interest.",
	"I then inquired about humanity's values toward law and war.

Highest.
Anything that actually benifits anyone is the lowest.
They'd rather claim those who fight for their 'countries' are heroes, when in the end it's needless suffering and mental anguish upon those both in and outside.
Refugees, veterans, victims of war, they suffer the same yet only the proclaimed 'nation' and symbolic flag is valued, not the individual.",
	"I then asked further about the countries.

They all follow the same arrogance.
Authority and power.
Doesn't matter falsly proclaimed alignments, they are one of the same.
Two sides of the same blade.
A dual edge.",
	"I then inquired about the various partical beam firings.

In accordance to severity.
The elder councillors were handled, all in the exact proximities.
The beams were vindication.",
	"I then asked about ex-Octhyratum cyberneticist Verius's involvement.

Still a issue of his own making, although still interesting how he got a individual whom was a part-time state journalist to use that Dal' Satrokian gravity cannon on that Azkuvalian inquisition ship to focus it upon the state of his employ, so irony and karma still exists plenty simply said to be precise: The Americas are shrouded by a chiming haze now, and most of society outside of such is ruins and remnants.
So in the end nature flourishes.",
	"I then inquired about their arrest after transporting human refugees to a habitable planet.

Verius explicitly broke the galactic code by making use of that weapon, and yet dealing with fascists and saving people from slavery is still somehow a crime according to intergalactic law.
Needless to say: fate intervened.",
	"I then asked how far humanity was in relation to space travel.

Barely, given how obsessed they were when it comes to allowing the rich to joyride in mockery of scientific interest, and the blatant disregard to actually indulge in proper space travel.
The arrogant obsession with Mars, over any realistic efforts that could've actually have been done was a trivial interference.",
	"As with the subject of healthcare.

Anywhere that had individuals in medical roles begin to purpetuate medical misinformation was doomed from the beginning.
In other words: Humanity's values relating to health and public safety were barely existant, during and after various pandemics, and plagues.
To be precise: A lot of people could still be alive, if people had a sense of basic reasoning.",
	"As far as other things: Psychological torture is heavily favoured by abusers, law, and other exploiters of corrupt systems.
There is no excuse upon the flame of heretical sin.
Blood and fear, child of lesser soul. To damnation upon mental hell.
Submission to authority and abuse intertwined with law and order. Mat'sar's willed domain.",
	"And with that: this concludes the interview.
Humanity was bound to it's own downfall, be that by self destruction, or slavery amongst the Azkuvalians.
Humanity has been given an oppurtunity to embrace more diverse forms of thought, whether it repeats history is for those amongst it to decide."
