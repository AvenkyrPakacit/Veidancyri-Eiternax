    "On this day, Einfernax, 65ae, High Queen of Syrenalia, Katasamnia Eathyratis has announced the formation of the Axilarium Unitarium.

They will henceforth be our combined law, and military.

The Illiatari now comprise the common and royal guard.",
	"All in The Axilarium are henceforth considered nobility in their own right.

The Exarch and Daminat, are henceforth to be respected by their rank. Failure to do so, will be subject to punishment!

Syrenalia is better united, no more strife amongst the kindred of the sister moons. The Axilarium will henceforth fight and die to ensure the safety of our pact."
